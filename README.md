# A dynamic social image generator

If your content doesn't naturally come with imagery for social media cards, generate one from the text of the content. Easy to hook up to any CMS, just output an entry's title and description into the right spots and voila.

All the text areas are `contenteditable` so you can tweak the preview before generating the image.
